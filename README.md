MLAlgorithm
===========
These are implementations of some Machine Learning Algorithms which are intended to be used as stand alone libraries. 
This is a work in progress. 

The eventual goal is to develop appropriate parallel versions of these algorithms using different paradigms and architectures in mind (eg. MapReduce, Shared memory SIMD etc.). 

Below is the list of algorithms implemented (or under implementation) thus far.

NOTE: Third party optimization algorithms are used for most of the cases 
and hence, issues with convergence should be dealt with carefully.

LIST OF ALGORITHMS

1. Multivariate Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression 
3. Neural Networks
4. Naive Bayes classifiers (Gaussian and text classification)
5. k-means clustering
6. Recommendation System (collaborative filtering)
